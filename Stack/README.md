## Stack
A data structure that follows ***LIFO** (Last in first out)* or **FILO** policy. Insertion and Deletion operations are done at one end called *TOP*.

**Methods of class Stack**
    - ```CreateStack()``` - This method will by default be called by constructor. It will create a new Stack of size entered by user and initialize it's top pointer to -1. If there existed a stack associated with that object then it will replace the previous stack.
    - ```push(int n)``` - Insert an element at top of the stack
    - ```pop()``` - Delete an element from stack.
    - ```Top()``` - Returns the position of top pointer
    - ```isEmpty()``` - Checks whether a Stack is empty or not and returns boolean value
    - ```isFull()``` - Check  whether a Stack is full or not and returns boolean value
