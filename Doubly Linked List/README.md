# Doubly Linked List

To traverse **forward** and **backward** we can use doubly linked list. It uses 2 pointers, one pointing to previous node and another to next node.

**Method used in Doubly Linked List**
  - ```insertBegin(int element)``` - Inserting an *element* at beginning of doubly linked list.
  - ```insertEnd(int element)``` - Inserting an *element* at the end of doubly linked list.
  - ```insertAt(int element, int position)``` - Inserting an *element* at a particular *position* in a doubly Linked List.
  - ```deleteBegin()``` - Deleting an element from beginning of a doubly Linked List and return's it's value.
  - ```deleteEnd()``` - Delete the last node of a doubly Linked List and returns it's value.
  - ```deleteAt(int position)``` - Deleting an element at particular *position* in a doubly Linked List and returning it's value.
  - ```display()``` - Displaying all the nodes of a doubly Linked List.
